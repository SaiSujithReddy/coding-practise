1. Why Yang ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is Yang ?

Yet Another next generation 
Data modelling lang
basically for Netconf - could be extended to Ovsdb, openflow
Notifications, events 

NETCONF is an IETF configuration management protocol and YANG is its data modeling language

YANG is a data modeling language designed to write data models for the NETCONF protocol. It provides the following features:
Human readable, and easy to learn representation 
Hierarchical configuration data models
Reusable types and groupings (structured types)
Extensibility through augmentation mechanisms
Supports definition of operations (RPCs)
Formal constraints for configuration validation
Data modularity through modules and sub-modules
Well defined versioning rules



YANG [1] is a data modeling language for the NETCONF network configuration protocol. 
The name is an acronym for "Yet Another Next Generation". The YANG data modeling language was developed by the NETMOD [2] 
working group in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and was published as RFC 6020 in October 2010. 
The data modeling language can be used to model both configuration data as well as state data of network elements. 
Furthermore, YANG can be used to define the format of event notifications emitted by network elements and it allows data modelers 
to define the signature of remote procedure calls that can be invoked on network elements via the NETCONF protocol.

YANG is a modular language representing data structures in an XML tree format. 
The data modeling language comes with a number of builtin data types. 
Additional application specific data types can be derived from the builtin data types. 
More complex reusable data structures can be represented as groupings. YANG data models can use XPATH expressions to define constraints on 
the elements of a YANG data model.

3. What is NETCONF ?

Distinction between configuration and state data 
Multiple configuration data stores (candidate, running, startup)
Configuration change validations
Configuration change transactions 
Selective data retrieval with filtering
Streaming and playback of event notifications
Extensible remote procedure call mechanism
